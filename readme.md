# React component with hover control

In this repo, I will do experiment for detecting child components events and
controlling the sensitivity of those events.

## Demo app

- [https://react-component-with-hover-control.surge.sh/](https://react-component-with-hover-control.surge.sh/)

```
npm intall
npm start
```
